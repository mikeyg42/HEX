# HEX
This is a work in progress implementation of Hex, the 2-player strategy board game famous for its illlustrious fans, its elegant gameplay, and gameplay simplicity. Because of this simple gameplay, it is not difficult to describe strategies rigorously and subject them to mathematical proof -- the game, and its numerous variants, appear regularly in math journals, in topics extending past graph theory and into the fields of combinatorics, algebraic topology, and even mathematical econonmics. 

This repo is so far all back end tech. I'm using Golang with postgres persistence. I've made a zap logger w/ lumberjack.
